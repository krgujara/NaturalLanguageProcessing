              <h2 class="home-subsection-heading" id="vn-approach">The VerbNet Approach</h2>
              <p class="paragraph">VerbNet groups together verbs with identical sets of syntactic frames and semantic predicate structures, as in the example below for class CUT-21.1-1:</p><img class="home-page-image" src="./VerbNet_files/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-01.28.40.png" width="800">
              <p class="paragraph">These classes may inherit frames from a parent class, resulting in a hierarchical structure:</p><img class="home-page-image" src="./VerbNet_files/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-01.28.18.png" width="400">
              <p class="paragraph">The classes in VerbNet are based on an extension of Levin (1993) classes, with the understanding that the syntactic form of a verb and its arguments informs its semantics. Observe, for example, the differences and similarities between the following two classes, CUT-21.1 and BREAK-45.1:</p><img class="home-page-image" src="./VerbNet_files/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-12.21.51.png" width="800"><img class="home-page-image" src="./VerbNet_files/Screen-Shot-2016-04-20-at-12.21.21.png" width="800">

              <h2 class="home-subsection-heading" id="how-it-works">How It All Works</h2>
              <p class="paragraph">Each VN class contains a set of syntactic descriptions, or syntactic frames, depicting the possible surface realizations of the argument structure for constructions such as transitive, intransitive, prepositional phrases, resultatives, and a large set of diathesis alternations. Semantic restrictions (such as animate, human, organization) are used to constrain the types of thematic roles allowed by the arguments, and further restrictions may be imposed to indicate the syntactic nature of the constituent likely to be associated with the thematic role. Syntactic frames may also be constrained in terms of which prepositions are allowed. Each frame is associated with explicit semantic information, expressed as a conjunction of boolean semantic predicates such as `motion,' `contact,' or `cause.' Each semantic predicate is associated with an event variable E that allows predicates to specify when in the event the predicate is true (start(E) for preparatory stage, during(E) for the culmination stage, and end(E) for the consequent stage). Figure 1. shows a complete entry for a frame in VerbNet class Hit-18.1.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">VerbNet has recently been integrated with 57 new classes from Korhonen and Briscoe's (2004) (K&amp;B) proposed extension to Levin's original classification (Kipper et al., 2006). This work has involved associating detailed syntactic-semantic descriptions to the K&amp;B classes, as well as organizing them appropriately into the existing VN taxonomy. An additional set of 53 new classes from Korhonen and Ryant (2005) (K&amp;R) have also been incorporated into VN. The outcome is a freely available resource which constitutes the most comprehensive and versatile Levin-style verb classification for English. After the two extensions VN has now also increased our coverage of PropBank tokens (Palmer et. al., 2005) from 78.45% to 90.86%, making feasible the creation of a substantial training corpus annotated with VN thematic role labels and class membership assignments, to be released in 2007. This will finally enable large-scale experimentation on the utility of syntax-based classes for improving the performance of syntactic parsers and semantic role labelers on new domains.
                <br>
                <br>Integrating the two recent extensions to Levin classes into VerbNet was an important step in order to address a major limitation of Levin's verb classification, namely the fact that verbs taking ADJP, ADVP, predicative, control and sentential complements were not included or addressed in depth in that work. This limitation excludes many verbs that are highly frequent in language. A summary of how this integration affected VN and the result of the extended VN is shown in Table 1. The figures show that our work enriched and expanded VN considerably. The number of first-level classes grew significantly (from 191 to 274), there was also a significant increase in the number of verb senses and lemmas, along with the set of semantic predicates and the syntactic restrictions on sentential complements.</p>

            <p class="member-bio-text">Martha Palmer is a Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science and an Institute of Cognitive Science Faculty Fellow. Her PhD is in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh. She is an Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) Fellow, and has won an Outstanding Graduate Advisor 2014 Award, a Boulder Faculty Assembly 2010 Research Award and was the Director of the 2011 Linguistics Institute in Boulder. Her research is focused on capturing elements of the meanings of words that can comprise automatic representations of complex sentences and documents. Supervised machine learning techniques rely on vast amounts of annotated training data so she and her students are engaged in providing data with word sense tags and semantic role labels for English, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and Urdu, funded by DARPA and NSF. They also train automatic sense taggers and semantic role labelers. A more recent focus is the application of these methods to biomedical journal articles and clinical notes, funded by NIH. She co-edits LiLT,&nbsp;Linguistic Issues in Language Technology, and has been a co-editor of the&nbsp;Journal of Natural Language Engineering&nbsp;and on the CLJ Editorial Board. She is a past President of ACL, and past Chair of SIGLEX and SIGHAN.</p>

              <h2 class="project-title">Figurative Language Detection</h2>
              <p class="project-description">VerbNet can be used for metaphor and figurative language detection by looking for violations to selectional restrictions imposed on thematic roles.
                <br>
                <br>For example, given the selectional restrictions to the thematic roles for verb DESTROY-44 as shown in the given image, we can say that any use of DESTROY-44 that violates the requirement for the patient to be a concrete object is a figurative use of the verb.
                <br>
                <br><strong>Literal :</strong>
                <br>The bomb destroyed the building [+concrete]
                <br>The rock damaged the fence [+conrete]
                <br>
                <br><strong>Figurative :</strong>
                <br>The speaker destroyed his argument [-concrete]
                <br>The politician damaged her reputation [-concrete]

Her PhD is in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh. She is an Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) Fellow, and has won an Outstanding Graduate Advisor 2014 Award, a Boulder Faculty Assembly 2010 Research Award and was the Director of the 2011 Linguistics Institute in Boulder. Her research is focused on capturing elements of the meanings of words that can comprise automatic representations of complex sentences and documents. Supervised machine learning techniques rely on vast amounts of annotated training data so she and her students are engaged in providing data with word sense tags and semantic role labels for English, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and Urdu, funded by DARPA and NSF. They also train automatic sense taggers and semantic role labelers. A more recent focus is the application of these methods to biomedical journal articles and clinical notes, funded by NIH. She co-edits LiLT,&nbsp;Linguistic Issues in Language Technology, and has been a co-editor of the&nbsp;Journal of Natural Language Engineering&nbsp;and on the CLJ Editorial Board. She is a past President of ACL, and past Chair of SIGLEX and SIGHAN.</p>

                <p class="project-description">The FrameNet project is building a lexical database of English that is both human- and machine-readable, based on annotating examples of how words are used in actual texts. From the student's point of view, it is a dictionary of more than 10,000 word senses, most of them with annotated examples that show the meaning and usage. For the researcher in Natural Language Processing, the more than 170,000 manually&nbsp;annotated&nbsp;sentences provide a unique training dataset for semantic role labeling, used in applications such as information extraction, machine translation, event recognition, sentiment analysis, etc. For students and teachers of linguistics it serves as a valence dictionary, with uniquely detailed evidence for the combinatorial properties of a core set of the English vocabulary. The project has been in operation at the&nbsp;International Computer Science Institute&nbsp;in Berkeley since 1997, supported primarily by the National Science Foundation, and the data is freely available for download; it has been downloaded and used by researchers around the world for a wide variety of purposes.</p>

              <p>In addition to the changes in syntactic frame names that characterized VerbNet 3.1, 3.2 also includes many updates to semantic role labels. These changes bring VerbNet semantic role labels more in line with the LIRICS labels. Documentation below.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Version 2.3 reflected the integration of the first set of classes into VerbNet, Korhonen and Briscoe (2004), as did VerbNet 2.0 and VerbNet 2.1, as well as the second set of classes, Korhonen and Ryant (2005). 2.3 also included minor revisions resulting from the mapping to FrameNet. These are all incorporated in 3.1.</p>
